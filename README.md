# Time Tracker

an app to track time spent working on activities from projects

## Future Objectives
- fix bug that occurs when time log page is open when there are no activities in databese
- fix bug where a project that does not exist is selected
- create way to re-use code that repeats to much(ex: search bar, home page button, ...)
- comment code to make it more understandable
- improve selector pages for more intuitive design
- style time_log_list_page
- rename time_log_list_page to something more intuitive
- change to online database (maybe with 'database per service pattern'??)
- create unit tests for project
- remove weird padding or insets from selector pages
